# Project Vision

This project is to create a web/mobile application that is intended to be used by students 
studying at Plymouth University, for the purpose of allowing those students to better
manage and deal with the stress of coursework and exams.
Due to the CoVID-19 pandemic the world sore the rise in numbers of mental health cases, to 
which a large proportion of them weâ€™re students that have struggled to find coping 
mechanisms when coursework and exam deadlines are looming over their heads. This 
creates anxiety and stress when they don't have the time for the support to be put in place 
due to their busy schedules.
The product is to act as a convenient digital partner to help support students with time 
management and stress relief while at university. The user can achieve this by having access 
to core features such as a Login/Signup system, social profile experience, meditation 
sessions Planner and Audio/Video Guides for guided meditation and all this can be access 
via a laptop or smart phone. 
The development of the application will involve implementing the front-end functionality 
such as User and Admin Panel features in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The backend 
development e.g. database for user records in MySQL, PHP and Node.js.
The design environment chosen for the application is the JetBrains WebStorm application
and access to a live environment MySQL database server.
To this end the aim of the mindfulness associate application is to help Plymouth University
students unwind, think clearly, and self-reflect hopefully allowing them to perform to the 
best of their ability.
